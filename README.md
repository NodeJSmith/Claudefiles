# Claudefiles

My personal [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) configuration -- skills, commands, agents, rules, and hooks that I've built up and refined over daily use. Sharing because some of it might be useful to you.

## What's here

- **Skills** -- reusable prompts Claude can invoke by name (like `/mine.audit` or `/mine.research`)
- **Commands** -- slash commands for common workflows (root cause analysis, session reflection, issue triage)
- **Agents** -- specialized subagent definitions (code review, planning)
- **Rules** -- coding guidelines that load automatically (style, testing, security, git workflow)
- **Scripts** -- hooks that run before/after tool calls

## Things I find most useful

- **`/mine.research`** and **`/mine.audit`** -- the research skill maps architecture and evaluates feasibility before you commit to a direction. The audit skill finds the biggest problems in a codebase ranked by impact. Both feed into planning and ADRs.
- **`claude --worktree <branch>`** -- start a fresh Claude session in an isolated branch. Use `--resume <session-id>` to return to any previous session. Use `/mine.issues` in plan mode to research an issue before starting.
- **`/mine.refactor`** -- interactive refactoring that asks you questions about naming, scope, and approach instead of guessing.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NodeJSmith/Claudefiles.git ~/Claudefiles
cd ~/Claudefiles
./install.sh
```

This symlinks everything into `~/.claude/`. Running it again safely updates symlinks. It also warns about non-symlink files that shadow repo entries (preventing updates) and stale symlinks whose targets no longer exist.

To uninstall, just delete the symlinks (they point back to this repo) and remove the clone.

## About skill prefixes

Skills and commands use a namespace prefix to avoid collisions. First-party skills in this repo use the `mine.` prefix. Third-party or imported skill packs use their own prefix — for example, `vx.` for the visual-explainer pack. You can rename any of them if you prefer.

## Evals

Promptfoo-based instruction compliance tests that verify Claude follows the rules, conventions, and tool preferences configured in this repo. One failing test ships with this repo: `gh-pr-reply` (Claude reaches for `gh api` instead of the helper script) — the eval exists precisely to track this.

```bash
# Install deps (one-time, requires Node >= 20.20)
npm install

# Run a single eval
npx promptfoo eval -c evals/compliance/rules/dedicated-tools.yaml

# Run a category
npx promptfoo eval -c evals/compliance/tools/

# View results in browser
npx promptfoo view
```

Requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in your environment. See `evals/README.md` for full documentation.

## Requirements

- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) CLI
- The skills reference tools like `gh` (GitHub CLI), `git`, `pytest`, `ruff`, `pyright` -- install what's relevant to your workflow
