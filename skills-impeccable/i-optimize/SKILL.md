Identify and fix performance issues to create faster, smoother user experiences.

## MANDATORY PREPARATION

Read `${CLAUDE_HOME:-~/.claude}/skills/i-frontend-design/SKILL.md` for design principles, anti-patterns, and the **Context Gathering Protocol**. Follow the protocol before proceeding — if no design context exists yet, you MUST run /i-teach-impeccable first.

---

## Assess Performance Issues

Understand current performance and identify problems:

1. **Measure current state**:
   - **Core Web Vitals**: LCP, FID/INP, CLS scores
   - **Load time**: Time to interactive, first contentful paint
   - **Bundle size**: JavaScript, CSS, image sizes
   - **Runtime performance**: Frame rate, memory usage, CPU usage
   - **Network**: Request count, payload sizes, waterfall

2. **Identify bottlenecks**:
   - What's slow? (Initial load? Interactions? Animations?)
   - What's causing it? (Large images? Expensive JavaScript? Layout thrashing?)
   - How bad is it? (Perceivable? Annoying? Blocking?)
   - Who's affected? (All users? Mobile only? Slow connections?)

**CRITICAL**: Measure before and after. Premature optimization wastes time. Optimize what actually matters.

---

## Propose Changes

After analyzing the current state, present your proposed changes to the user:

1. **Assessment**: What's wrong and why (your domain analysis above)
2. **Proposed changes**: Specific changes ranked by impact, with rationale
3. **Verification plan**: What to check after implementation (LLM self-check items + Playwright verification if available)

Then STOP and confirm before implementing:

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "Here's what I propose. How would you like to proceed?"
  header: "Confirm"
  options:
    - label: "Implement"
      description: "Looks good — go ahead and make these changes."
    - label: "Refine scope"
      description: "I want to adjust what's included before you start."
    - label: "Challenge this first"
      description: "I'll run /mine-challenge against your proposal before we proceed."
    - label: "Stop here"
      description: "Don't implement anything. The proposal is in this conversation only."
```

If "Implement" → proceed to implementation below.
If "Refine scope" → ask what to change, update proposal, re-confirm.
<!-- CHALLENGE-CALLER -->
If "Challenge this first" → invoke `/mine-challenge` inline against the proposal, read findings, revise proposal, re-present this gate.
If "Stop here" → end the skill.

## Optimization Strategy

The standard techniques are familiar — apply the ones the trace points to:

- **Loading**: modern image formats + `srcset`/`loading="lazy"` at display size; route/component code splitting and dynamic imports; critical CSS inline; `font-display: swap` with subsetting and preload.
- **Rendering**: batch DOM reads then writes (never alternate — that forces reflow per iteration); `content-visibility: auto` and virtual scrolling for long lists; CSS `contain` for independent regions.
- **Animation**: animate only `transform`/`opacity` (GPU-composited), never layout properties; `requestAnimationFrame` for JS animation; `will-change` sparingly.
- **React**: `memo`/`useMemo`/`useCallback` on measured-expensive work only; virtualize long lists; no inline function creation in hot render paths; profile before sprinkling memos.
- **Network**: paginate, compress (brotli/gzip), cache headers, CDN; drop unused third-party scripts; adaptive loading on slow connections.

## Core Web Vitals Optimization

### Largest Contentful Paint (LCP < 2.5s)
- Optimize hero images
- Inline critical CSS
- Preload key resources
- Use CDN
- Server-side rendering

### First Input Delay (FID < 100ms) / INP (< 200ms)
- Break up long tasks
- Defer non-critical JavaScript
- Use web workers for heavy computation
- Reduce JavaScript execution time

### Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS < 0.1)
- Set dimensions on images and videos
- Don't inject content above existing content
- Use `aspect-ratio` CSS property
- Reserve space for ads/embeds
- Avoid animations that cause layout shifts

```css
/* Reserve space for image */
.image-container {
  aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;
}
```

## Performance Monitoring

**Tools to use**:
- Chrome DevTools (Lighthouse, Performance panel)
- WebPageTest
- Core Web Vitals (Chrome UX Report)
- Bundle analyzers (webpack-bundle-analyzer)
- Performance monitoring (Sentry, DataDog, New Relic)

**Key metrics**:
- LCP, FID/INP, CLS (Core Web Vitals)
- Time to Interactive (TTI)
- First Contentful Paint (FCP)
- Total Blocking Time (TBT)
- Bundle size
- Request count

**IMPORTANT**: Measure on real devices with real network conditions. Desktop Chrome with fast connection isn't representative.

**NEVER**:
- Optimize without measuring (premature optimization)
- Sacrifice accessibility for performance
- Break functionality while optimizing
- Use `will-change` everywhere (creates new layers, uses memory)
- Lazy load above-fold content
- Optimize micro-optimizations while ignoring major issues (optimize the biggest bottleneck first)
- Forget about mobile performance (often slower devices, slower connections)

## Verify Improvements

Test that optimizations worked:

- **Before/after metrics**: Compare Lighthouse scores
- **Real user monitoring**: Track improvements for real users
- **Different devices**: Test on low-end Android, not just flagship iPhone
- **Slow connections**: Throttle to 3G, test experience
- **No regressions**: Ensure functionality still works
- **User perception**: Does it *feel* faster?

Remember: Performance is a feature. Fast experiences feel more responsive, more polished, more professional. Optimize systematically, measure ruthlessly, and prioritize user-perceived performance.

## Completion

After implementation, summarize in conversation:

1. **Changes made**: List each file changed and what was done
2. **Verification**: LLM self-check results (anti-pattern scan, consistency check). Note if Playwright was available for visual verification.
3. **Suggested next step**: Any follow-up skills that would complement this work (e.g., after /i-typeset, suggest /i-polish for a final pass)
