Increase visual impact and personality in designs that are too safe, generic, or visually underwhelming, creating more engaging and memorable experiences.

## MANDATORY PREPARATION

Read `${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-~/.claude}/skills/i-frontend-design/SKILL.md` for design principles, anti-patterns, and the **Context Gathering Protocol**. Follow the protocol before proceeding — if no design context exists yet, you MUST run /i-teach-impeccable first.

---

## Assess Current State

Analyze what makes the design feel too safe or boring:

1. **Identify weakness sources**:
   - **Generic choices**: System fonts, basic colors, standard layouts
   - **Timid scale**: Everything is medium-sized with no drama
   - **Low contrast**: Everything has similar visual weight
   - **Static**: No motion, no energy, no life
   - **Predictable**: Standard patterns with no surprises
   - **Flat hierarchy**: Nothing stands out or commands attention

2. **Understand the context**:
   - What's the brand personality? (How far can we push?)
   - What's the purpose? (Marketing can be bolder than financial dashboards)
   - Who's the audience? (What will resonate?)
   - What are the constraints? (Brand guidelines, accessibility, performance)

If any of these are not answered by design context (`design/context.md`, `.impeccable.md`, or `design/direction.md`), STOP and call the AskUserQuestion tool to clarify. Use the answer to inform your amplification strategy. If the answer is unclear or deferred, proceed by increasing contrast and weight only — no palette changes.

**CRITICAL**: "Bolder" doesn't mean chaotic or garish. It means distinctive, memorable, and confident. Think intentional drama, not random chaos.

**WARNING - AI SLOP TRAP**: When making things "bolder," AI defaults to the same tired tricks. These are the OPPOSITE of bold—they're generic. Review the [anti-patterns reference](../i-frontend-design/reference/anti-patterns.md) before proceeding. Bold means distinctive, not "more effects."

## Plan Amplification

Create a strategy to increase impact while maintaining coherence:

- **Focal point**: What should be the hero moment? (Pick ONE, make it amazing)
- **Personality direction**: Maximalist chaos? Elegant drama? Playful energy? Dark moody? Choose a lane — but stay within the existing palette, type choices, and visual rhetoric by default. Only depart from the established aesthetic when the design context (`design/context.md`, `.impeccable.md`) explicitly calls for it, or the user asks.
- **Risk budget**: How experimental can we be? Push boundaries within constraints.
- **Hierarchy amplification**: Make big things BIGGER, small things smaller (increase contrast)

**IMPORTANT**: Bold design must still be usable. Impact without function is just decoration.

## Propose Changes

After analyzing the current state, present your proposed changes to the user:

1. **Assessment**: What's wrong and why (your domain analysis above)
2. **Proposed changes**: Specific changes ranked by impact, with rationale
3. **Verification plan**: What to check after implementation (LLM self-check items + Playwright verification if available)

Then STOP and confirm before implementing:

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "Here's what I propose. How would you like to proceed?"
  header: "Confirm"
  options:
    - label: "Implement"
      description: "Looks good — go ahead and make these changes."
    - label: "Refine scope"
      description: "I want to adjust what's included before you start."
    - label: "Challenge this first"
      description: "I'll run /mine-challenge against your proposal before we proceed."
    - label: "Stop here"
      description: "Don't implement anything. The proposal is in this conversation only."
```

If "Implement" → proceed to implementation below.
If "Refine scope" → ask what to change, update proposal, re-confirm.
<!-- CHALLENGE-CALLER -->
If "Challenge this first" → invoke `/mine-challenge` inline against the proposal, read findings, revise proposal, re-present this gate.
If "Stop here" → end the skill.

## Amplify the Design

Systematically increase impact across these dimensions:

Push hard, but the "not X" anchors are where bold diverges from AI slop:

- **Typography**: dramatic scale jumps (3x-5x, not 1.5x); weight contrast (900 paired with 200, not 600 with 400); monospace as an intentional accent, not as a lazy "dev tool" default.
- **Color**: more saturated and energetic (but not neon); let one bold color own 60%; multi-stop gradients that are *not* the generic purple-to-blue AI slop. Tinted neutrals that harmonize with the palette.
- **Spatial drama**: hero elements 3-5x larger; break the grid; tension-filled asymmetry over centered balance; dramatic white space (100-200px gaps, not 20-40px); intentional overlap.
- **Visual effects**: large soft shadows (not generic drop shadows on rounded rectangles); grain, halftone, duotone — *not* glassmorphism (overused AI slop); thick or custom borders, not a rounded rectangle with one colored edge.
- **Composition**: clear hero focal points, diagonal flows, full-bleed elements, unexpected proportions (70/30, 80/20 — not the golden ratio by reflex).
- **Motion**: dramatic, noticeable — see /i-animate.

**NEVER**:
- Add effects randomly without purpose (chaos ≠ bold)
- Sacrifice readability for aesthetics (body text must be readable)
- Make everything bold (then nothing is bold - need contrast)
- Ignore accessibility (bold design must still meet WCAG standards)
- Overwhelm with motion (animation fatigue is real)
- Copy trendy aesthetics blindly (bold means distinctive, not derivative)

## Verify Quality

Ensure amplification maintains usability and coherence:

- **NOT AI slop**: Does this look like every other AI-generated "bold" design? If yes, start over.
- **Still functional**: Can users accomplish tasks without distraction?
- **Coherent**: Does everything feel intentional and unified?
- **Memorable**: Will users remember this experience?
- **Performant**: Do all these effects run smoothly?
- **Accessible**: Does it still meet accessibility standards?

**The test**: If you showed this to someone and said "AI made this bolder," would they believe you immediately? If yes, you've failed. Bold means distinctive, not "more AI effects."

Remember: Bold design is confident design. It takes risks, makes statements, and creates memorable experiences. But bold without strategy is just loud. Be intentional, be dramatic, be unforgettable.

## Completion

After implementation, summarize in conversation:

1. **Changes made**: List each file changed and what was done
2. **Verification**: LLM self-check results (anti-pattern scan, consistency check). Note if Playwright was available for visual verification.
3. **Suggested next step**: Any follow-up skills that would complement this work (e.g., after /i-typeset, suggest /i-polish for a final pass)
