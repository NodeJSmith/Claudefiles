## Skills

### Core Skills (`mine.*`)

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `mine.address-pr-issues` | Triage and resolve PR blockers — review comments, merge conflicts, and failing CI |
| `mine.audit` | Systematic codebase health audit — surfaces aging code, brittle designs, missing tests, and accumulated debt, ranked by impact |
| `mine.brainstorm` | Open-ended idea generation with four parallel thinkers — divergent ideas ranked by user-chosen criteria, with handoff to research or planning |
| `mine.build` | Single entry point — routes between direct implementation and the full caliper v2 workflow (define → plan → orchestrate → ship) |
| `mine.challenge` | Adversarial review using 3 generic + up to 2 domain-specialist critics — assumes the target is wrong, finds out why, argues for better. Pre-flight catches surface issues and validates architecture before launching critics; reduces to 2 critics on re-challenges. Works on code, specs, designs, briefs, skill files, docs |
| `mine.clean-code` | Stylistic quality review — dispatches llm-checker, lazy-checker, and nitpicker in parallel; flags LLM-bias patterns, deferred debt, and hyper-critical style issues |
| `mine.commit-push` | Commit and push changes to the current branch |
| `mine.create-issue` | Codebase-aware issue creation — investigates the code to produce well-structured issues with acceptance criteria and affected areas for automated triage |
| `mine.create-pr` | Review branch changes and create a PR on GitHub or Azure DevOps |
| `mine.debug` | Systematic debugging — 4-phase root-cause investigation with escalation protocol and error tracking |
| `mine.decompose` | Codebase decomposition analysis — finds split opportunities using Git behavioral signals and structural metrics, proposes concrete splits with ROI-based prioritization |
| `mine.define` | Proportional discovery + codebase investigation + architecture interrogation → design.md with one sign-off gate |
| `mine.eval-repo` | Evaluate a third-party GitHub repo before adopting it — test coverage, code quality, maintenance health, bus factor |
| `mine.gap-close` | Conversational completeness review — surveys artifacts against per-type checklists, triages gaps by severity, fills them one question at a time |
| `mine.grill` | Multi-angle interrogation of a raw idea — product, design, engineering, scope, and adversarial lenses. Produces a brief.md that feeds into /mine.define |
| `mine.issues-triage` | Batch codebase-aware issue triage — parallel Haiku subagents assess actual complexity and effort by reading the code, not just titles |
| `mine.mockup` | Generate self-contained HTML mockup files — reads `design/context.md` for consistent styling, delivers to a session temp directory |
| `mine.mutation-test` | Mutation testing — intentionally break code to verify tests catch real bugs |
| `mine.orchestrate` | Execute task files one-by-one with parallel spec/code/integration reviewer pass; post-execution implementation review |
| `mine.plan` | Design doc → task files (T01, T02, …) with FR/AC traceability, validation gate, and 10-point traceability review + approve/revise/abandon gate |
| `mine.prior-art` | Survey how others solve a problem — web-first research for mid-design architectural questions |
| `mine.research` | Interactive research workflow — gathers user intent, dispatches the researcher agent, presents the brief |
| `mine.review` | Comprehensive branch review — dispatches code-reviewer, integration-reviewer, and wtf-reviewer in parallel, consolidates findings into one prioritized report |
| `mine.ship` | Commit, push, and create a PR in one step |
| `mine.tool-gaps` | Surface missing CLI functionality and unscripted recurring patterns by mining session history for workarounds |
| `mine.visual-qa` | Live visual QA — Playwright captures screenshots, then two agents analyze them with structural separation (one sees each page in isolation, the other sees all pages at once) |
| `mine.worktree-rebase` | Detect when the parent repo is currently on a feature branch and rebase this worktree branch onto it (run immediately after creating the worktree) |
| `mine.write-skill` | Guided skill creation — gathers requirements, drafts SKILL.md, validates quality checklist, auto-wires routing |

Optional bundle capabilities files (install with their bundle): `capabilities-impeccable.md` (Frontend), `capabilities-memory.md` (Memory), `capabilities-cli.md` (CLI).

## Hooks

Event-driven scripts that run before/after tool calls.

| Hook | Event | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `tmux-remind.sh` | SessionStart | Reminds Claude to rename the tmux session |
| `sudo-poll.sh` | PreToolUse (Bash) | Deny-then-poll for sudo — detects cached credentials or waits 30s for user to `sudo -v` in another pane |
| `pytest-guard.sh` | PreToolUse (Bash) | Deny bare pytest — requires `timeout` wrapper; per-repo config via `.claude/pytest-guard.json` for custom timeouts, flag denylist, or full block (`deny_all`) |
| `pytest-loop-detector.sh` | PreToolUse (Bash) | Deny pytest after repeated failures: 3 consecutive runs without edits, or 8 total failures since last success — nudges to `/mine.debug` |
| `pytest-loop-reset.sh` | PostToolUse (Edit/Write/MultiEdit/NotebookEdit) | Reset the no-edit pytest failure counter when code changes are made (total counter intentionally preserved) |
| `pytest-loop-status.sh` | PostToolUse (Bash) | Record pytest exit code for loop detector failure tracking |
| `pytest-detect.sh` | (sourced) | Shared pytest detection patterns for loop detector and status hooks |
| `cm-memory-setup` (package) | SessionStart | Initialize memory DB, trigger background import if needed |
| `cm-onboarding` (package) | SessionStart (startup) | Inject MEMORY.md context and greet the user with persistent memory |
| `cm-memory-context` (package) | SessionStart (startup\|clear) | Load memory context into the session |
| `cm-consolidation-check` (package) | SessionStart (startup\|clear) | Check if memory consolidation is needed |
| `cm-clear-handoff` (package) | SessionEnd (clear) | Write a handoff note before `/clear` |
| `context-tier.sh` | PreToolUse (*) | Inject context window tier guidance on tier change or periodic heartbeat (every 25 calls) — prevents hallucinated context pressure |
| `tmux-drift-check.sh` | PreToolUse (*) | Periodically remind Claude to verify tmux session name alignment with current work (every 30 calls) |
| `phrase-monitor.sh` | PreToolUse (*) | Log assistant rationalization phrases (context pressure, minimize changes, scope avoidance, etc.) — observation-only with optional ntfy notifications |
| `cm-memory-sync` (package) | Stop | Sync current session to the conversation database |

> **Context tier setup:** The `context-tier.sh` hook reads a sidecar file written by `claude-context-writer`. To enable it, add `claude-context-writer` to your `statusLine.command` in settings — either by itself or in front of your existing command:
>
> ```json
> "statusLine": { "type": "command", "command": "claude-context-writer" }
> "statusLine": { "type": "command", "command": "claude-context-writer ~/bin/mine/starship-claude" }
> ```

## Helper Scripts

## Packages

`spec-helper` and `merge-settings` are part of the base and always install. `claude-memory` installs with the Memory bundle. `ado-api` is not wired into a bundle — if you work in Azure DevOps repos, install it on its own with `uv tool install -e packages/ado-api`. Any package can be installed manually the same way.

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `ado-api` | Azure DevOps CLI — builds, logs, PR management, work items, approvals |
| `claude-memory` | Conversation memory system — session DB, hooks, `cm-*` CLI entry points |
| `merge-settings` | Three-layer settings merger (`claude-merge-settings` CLI) |
| `spec-helper` | Spec directory management — `validate`, `checkpoint-*`, `next-number`, `init`, `archive` |
