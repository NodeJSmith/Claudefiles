# Changelog

All notable changes to this Claudefiles repository are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `/mine.eval-repo` skill — evaluate third-party GitHub repos before adopting them; assesses test coverage, code quality, maintenance health, bus factor, and project maturity with parallel subagents (#1)
- `CLAUDE.md` project instructions for repo contributors (#2)
- `bin/` directory with `gh-pr-threads`, `gh-pr-reply`, `gh-pr-resolve-thread` helper scripts (symlinked to `~/.local/bin` by installer) (#2)
- `settings.json` with hook wiring and default permissions for Claudefiles-owned tools (#2)

### Changed
- `/mine.create-pr` now uses `!` prefix for Azure DevOps PR references in changelogs (instead of `#`, which links to work items) and suggests adding a `CHANGELOG.md` if one doesn't exist (#3)
- `/mine.pre-compact` command now outputs a ready-to-paste `/compact` prompt instead of offering to run it (#2)
